qf(sig level, num df, denom df)
  - num df is df associated with model or treatments typically
  - i.e. if you have 4 treatment levels, you have 3 df and is the num df in above syntax
  - denom df is df associated with error
  - i.e. if you have 12 total observations among these 4 treatment levels, you have 8 df and is the denom df in above syntax
  - i.e. qf(.95, 3, 8) = 5.16

1-pf(f-val, num df, denom df)

   - finds probability of a value at or more extreme under the f dist
   - i.e. 1-pf(5.16, 3, 8)
